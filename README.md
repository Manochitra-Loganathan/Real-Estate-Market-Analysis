# Real Estate Market Analysis Dashboard

## The Brief
A real estate firm wanted to analyze market trends and property prices across different regions to help buyers, sellers, and agents make informed decisions. The goal was to develop a dashboard that visualizes key metrics such as price trends, demand patterns, property types, and market growth over time. The firm had large datasets of property listings, sales, and regional data but lacked an easy way to derive insights from this data.

## Task
As a data analyst, I was tasked with creating an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize the real estate market, track price trends, and identify areas with high demand. The dashboard should provide actionable insights that help agents and clients assess market conditions, evaluate property values, and make strategic decisions.

## What I Learned
- The data provided included multiple CSV files with details on property listings, prices, sale dates, property types, and regions.
- Data cleaning and transformation were necessary to handle missing values, normalize prices, and calculate year-over-year trends.
- Built a relational data model by establishing relationships between property data, sales, and regional data to enable dynamic filtering and in-depth analysis.
- Designed an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize key metrics such as price trends, property demand, and regional growth.
- Created custom visuals like **heat maps** to show regional demand and **line charts** to analyze price trends over time.
- Implemented drill-through functionality to allow detailed insights into individual property listings, including historical prices and growth patterns.
- Added dynamic slicers for filtering properties based on location, price range, and property type.
